# Stasis

Stasis is a static site generator built with PHP that brings the flexibility and architecture of modern web frameworks 
into the static world. Stasis does not impose restrictions — instead, it provides an extensible set of tools to generate
static content. With Stasis, you are free to choose your own directory structure, template engine, dependency injection 
container, etc.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is currently under active development, and some parts of the public interface may change in future 
> releases. While Stasis is already mature enough, expect occasional adjustments as the framework continues to evolve.
